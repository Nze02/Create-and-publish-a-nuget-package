# Create-and-publish-a-nuget-package

Often times, we use NuGet packages in our projects and we are familiar with the procedure of adding a NuGet package to a project.

In this documentation, we'll discuss in detail how to create and publish NuGet Packages.

### What is NuGet?

Nuget is a mechanism through which developers can create, share, and consume useful code. Often such code is bundled into "packages" that contain compiled code (as DLLs) along with other content needed in the projects that consume these packages.

It is an essential tool for any modern development platform.

### What is a NuGet-package?

Very simple, it’s a container with components inside, designed for re-usability and sharing. It can contain class libraries or even an entire project including the .cs files. It’s then encapsulated into a redistributable package for anyone to use.
